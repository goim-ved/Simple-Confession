## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed along with PyQt5:
```sh
pip install PyQt5
```

### Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/goim-ved/Simple-Confession.git
cd Simple-Confession
```

## Running the App
Run the following command:
```sh
python main.py
```

## Folder Structure
```
Simple-Confession/
│── images/
│   ├── heart.png
│── main.py
│── README.md
```

## How It Works
1. The app opens a **600x600px** window with a label and a button.
2. The label displays **"Confession"** initially.
3. The button is placed at the center of the window.
4. Clicking the button updates the label text to **"I love you!"**.

## Customization
- Change the background color, font, or button style by modifying `main.py`.
- Replace the `heart.png` icon in the **images/** folder with your own.
